# # Play Store Apps Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Google Play Store dataset to extract valuable insights regarding app ratings, category distribution, user reviews, and performance metrics. The aim is to understand the key factors influencing app popularity and performance.

# Key Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
Explore app ratings, user reviews, and category-wise distribution of apps.
Visualize relationships between app size, installation counts, and content ratings.
Identify trends in app monetization strategies, performance, and customer engagement.
Provide actionable insights to optimize app development and marketing strategies.
Dataset
The dataset contains information about various apps listed on the Google Play Store. Key columns include:

App Name: Name of the application.
Category: The category to which the app belongs.
Rating: The rating of the app on the Play Store.
Reviews: The number of user reviews.
Installs: The number of times the app has been installed.
Size: The size of the application in MB.
Price: The cost of the application, if paid.
Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For analysis and visualization.
Key Steps
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values in columns like Rating and Size.
Converted categorical features into numerical form for better analysis.
Treated outliers and normalized data where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed the distribution of app ratings and reviews.
Examined the category-wise distribution of apps to identify the most popular categories.
Investigated relationships between app size, install counts, and content ratings.
Visualizations:

Used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore the data visually.
Identified patterns in app size, content rating, and their impact on user ratings and installs.
Statistical Analysis:

Conducted correlation analysis to determine the impact of app size, price, and category on app ratings and user engagement.
Applied grouping and aggregation to summarize performance metrics by app category and content rating.
Results
The analysis revealed that apps with higher ratings tend to have more installations and reviews, especially in popular categories like Games and Social.
Paid apps generally have higher ratings, but free apps dominate the install counts.
App size has a moderate correlation with installs, but larger apps are often seen in categories like Games and Productivity.
